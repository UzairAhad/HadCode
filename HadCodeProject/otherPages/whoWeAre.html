                Hello everyone, welcome to the HadCode official portal, i'm the head of this orgization. <br>
                I'm psuring my BS-Computer Engineering degree from Sir Syed University Of Engineering and Technoogy
                being a computer student i have too much interest in Computer Technologies and my special deeply relation
                is with AI and Web and Mobile Application Developments.
                I looked around me there was alot of peoples who are intrested in Computer but they don't have affordable 
                situation. In my opinion thats how telent has been killed. So i decide to open a free of cost suppotive
                organization for poor peoples.
